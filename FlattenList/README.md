# Flatten a List (Recursively)

## Instructions
Write a recursive function that takes a multi-dimensional list, and returns a one-dimensional list.  For the love of God, write some tests.

### Ex 1
```python
input = [1, 2, [3], [4,5]]
output = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Ex 2
```python
input = [1, [2], [3, [4, 5, [6]]], 7]
output = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
